   1. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muller%27s_ratchet][Muller's ratchet {Wikipedia}]]
      - Definition ::
        Absence of recombination, especially in an asexual population,
        results in accumulation of deleterious mutations (harmful mutations)
        in an irreversible manner

      - Genetic Information Exchange in "Asexual" Organisms.
        Functions similar to Genertic Crossover

        #+begin_quote
        Among protists and prokaryotes, a plethora of supposedly asexual organisms exists.
        More and more are being shown to exchange genetic information through a variety of mechanisms.

        In contrast, the genomes of mitochondria and chloroplasts do not recombine and would undergo Muller's ratchet were they not as small as they are

      - Definition ::
        A ratchet effect is an instance of the restrained ability of human processes to be reversed once a specific thing has happened

      - It is related to feature creep in software development, scope creep in manufacturing and mission creep in military planning

      - Definition ::
        #+begin_quote
The Collingridge dilemma is a *methodological quandary* in which *efforts to influence or control the further development of technology face a double-bind problem:*

    - An information problem:
      Impacts cannot be easily predicted until the technology is extensively developed and widely used.

    - A power problem:
      Control or change is difficult when the technology has become entrenched.

What Is Life?

¬†Posted onDec 30 2019¬†¬†12 mins read

What is life? This question keeps many people awake at night and has led to rafts of definitions, some involving features (procreation, metabolism and so forth), some involving chemistry, entropy or energy flux and some are of a more¬†philosophical¬†bent. A¬†BBC article noted¬†there are¬†over 100 definitions of life¬†and it claims all are wrong.

And indeed it does appear to be quite a challenge - every hard and fast rule is violated somewhere in biology. There are things that are clearly alive, but never replicate. Plants typically do not move yet are extremely vital. Viruses do make copies of themselves, but need a host to do so. Are they alive? And once you have it all figured out, some wise person comes up with a crystal that somehow manages to create copies of itself, and points out that these copies even ‚Äòinherit‚Äô characteristics. Is the crystal alive? Similarly, ‚Äúfire‚Äù consumes elements, moves and even replicates. Yet calling fire a life form seems odd.

As fascinating as these discussions are, they are also somewhat silly. It is a bit like a bunch of people standing in an electronics store and pointing at phones, watches, cameras and TVs and asking which of these are computers. They may note that the watch exhibits many phone-like features, and a modern phone is clearly a computer, but most watches can‚Äôt actually make calls without a phone nearby. They may also argue that the modern TV is not functional without an internet connection, so does it qualify as a computer? They are sure however that an SD card is not a computer, it only stores data.

Whereas to seasoned technologists this is not even a discussion - all of these things are computers of course, and in fact almost all of them by now run a variant of UNIX. The architecture answers the question for us - all of them have billions of transistors that make up CPU cores, RAM, and there is a operating system that runs on top of these. To us, this is not worth l
